 #### About this project
This study proposed the android-based application named ‘Thai-Licious: Thai Food Classified System for Tourists on Smartphone’, which consists of two parts. The first part is a Thai food classification model which is developed by using a convolutional neural network-based Inception-v3 (GoogLeNet) technique to distinguish between 5 classes of Thai food menus, which are green curry with chicken, mango sticky rice, pad thai, Thai papaya salad and tom yum soup with shrimp. The performance of proposed is evaluated by a validation dataset that achieved an overall accuracy of 93.99%. The second part is an application on the smartphone, an Android operating system, to facilitate tourists to search for Thai food menus from pictures and provide more information about Thai food to the tourists.

**Update:** some of Google Maps feature might not working due to a billing problem
